My personal portfolio website — the final project for FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design certification. Built in 2024 to showcase my first projects and mark the completion of this learning journey.

The project only consists of **HTML** + **CSS** and was made as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.

## 🎨 About the Project

After four projects of learning forms, tributes, documentation, and landing pages — this was the moment to put it all together. A portfolio to showcase everything I had built up to that point. Even right now I have fond memories of it. I like how simple and at the same time stylish it is. And it is somehow responsive.

I remember being particularly proud of:
- The **full-viewport welcome section** with its background
- Making the navbar stay fixed without covering content
- My first real attempt at a responsive grid for projects
- Finally understanding `vh` units and why they matter

Also I changed the original project links to the new github repos! The images were already local for the project so i only changed the paths for gh pages.

Looking at it now, I can see the rookie decisions — but that's exactly why I wanted to preserve it. This is where I started.
